# dfreerksen/dotfiles

Everyone has their own setup for their dotfiles. Here is mine.

## Requirements

#### iTerm2 Nightly

Currently requires [iTerm 2 nightly build](https://www.iterm2.com/) so it can use 24 bit colors.

If you don't want to use the iTerm 2 nightly build, open `.aliases` and search for `alias vim`. The one that is commented out, that's the one you want for 256 color.

#### Homebrew

Fresh install Neovim

```
brew tap neovim/homebrew-neovim
brew install --HEAD neovim
```

If youâ€™ve already installed Neovim

```
brew reinstall --HEAD neovim
```

## Installation

Before installing scripts, you will be asked `This may overwrite existing files in your home directory. Are you sure? (y/n)`. Confirm whether or not you want to overwrite existing files.

```bash
sh bootstrap.sh
```

To install the scripts without first asking to overwrite files

```bash
sh bootstrap.sh --force
```

or

```bash
sh bootstrap.sh -f
```

## Git Configuration

#### .gitconfig.local

```bash
touch ~/.gitconfig.local
```

It is *not* a good idea to commit this file to any repository.

```
[user]

  name = Your Name
  email = your@email.com

[github]

  user = your_username
  token = your_token

[bitbucket]

  user = your_username
  token = your_token
```

#### Git CLI

If you know for a fact once you you run `sh bootstrap.sh` to set this up and you will *never* run it again. Maybe you don't need a `~/.gitconfig.local` file.

Set your name

```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
```

Set your email address

```bash
git config --global user.email "me@example.com"
```

Github user and token can be set using `user` or `github`

```bash
git config --global user.user "username"
git config --global github.user "username"
```

> If you ever decide to run `sh bootstrap.sh` again, you'll have to run these commands again. Otherwise, you need a `~/.gitconfig.local` file.
