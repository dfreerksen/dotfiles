# Dotfiles

Everyone has their own setup for their dotfiles. Here is my setup.


## Installation

Before installing scripts, you will be asked `This may overwrite existing files in your home directory. Are you sure? (y/n)`. Confirm whether or not you want to overwrite existing files.

```bash
$ sh sync.sh
```

To install the scripts without first asking to overwrite files

```bash
$ sh sync.sh --force
```

or

```bash
$ sh sync.sh -f
```

## Contributing

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
